              2FASTT was born from a simple idea: running should be fun, social, and accessible to everyone. 
              Founded at Rutgers University, we're more than just a running club â€“ we're a community that 
              welcomes all paces, all backgrounds, and all levels of experience.

                  To create an inclusive space where students can connect through running, build lasting 
                  friendships, and develop a healthy relationship with fitness. Whether you're training 
                  for a marathon or just want to jog around campus, you belong here.

                At 2FASTT, we believe that the best workouts happen when you're having fun. There's no 
                pressure to be fast, no judgment about your pace, and no requirement to compete. We're 
                here to support each other, celebrate small wins, and make running an enjoyable part 
                of campus life.
